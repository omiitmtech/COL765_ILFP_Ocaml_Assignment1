# COL765_ILFP_Ocaml_Assignment1
Assignment 1: Sets This functional programming assignment requires you to represent finite sets in two different ways, using two different data types:  (a) OCaml lists, and (b) OCaml functions:


# Assignment 1: Submission instructions

1) You have to submit one file named "entryNumber.ml". For eg: 2020MCS3432.ml

2) Your file should have functions organised into modules "Ls" (for part (a)) and "Cf" (for part (b)). We should be able to run the function using "Ls.union l1 l2", "Cf.intersection f1 f2" etc.

3) We are going to import the functions implemented by you using:

# use "2020MCS3432.ml"

After importing this, we should be able to use the functions implemented by you.
